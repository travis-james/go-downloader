What should it do?

- Command line:
file-downloader blehbleh.com/appv1.gzip boof.net/garo87.jpg ...etc

- File will be named, appv1.gzip, garo87.jpg..., need to think how
I will slice that.

- If filename already exists, do nothing.
- If download fails, delete file.


THE NAME: go-downloader. Hyphen seems a bit strange, but seems to work:
