What should it do?

- Command line:
file-downloader blehbleh.com/appv1.gzip boof.net/garo87.jpg -d /etc/save_here

- File will be named, appv1.gzip, garo87.jpg..., need to think how
I will slice that.

- If filename already exists, do nothing.
- If download fails, delete file.


THE NAME: go-downloader. Hyphen seems a bit strange, but seems to work:

BELOW is more complicated. Perhaps I could pass json on the Command
line to be consumed to do this.
downloader.NewClient(
    DownloadOptions{
        ResourceName
        Timeout
        FileDestination
        FileCompression (bool)
        ChecksumVerification (bool)
        Retry
        Headers
    },
    DownloadOptions{

    }
    FileCompression
    ChecksumVerification
    Timeout
    Retry
    Headers
)
